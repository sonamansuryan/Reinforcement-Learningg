# Tic-Tac-Toe Reinforcement Learning Project

## Overview
A practical implementation of Reinforcement Learning principles applied to Tic-Tac-Toe, developed at the National Polytechnic University of Armenia (NPUA). This system creates an intelligent agent that learns optimal gameplay through experience.

## Key Components

- **Learning Agent**: Uses reinforcement learning to develop strategies through exploration and rewards
- **User Interface**: Allows human players to challenge the trained agent
- **Game Controller**: Manages gameplay, validates moves, and determines outcomes
- **State Management**: Efficiently tracks all possible game configurations

## Operating Modes

### Training
The agent learns through:
- Exploring possible game states
- Updating strategies based on rewards
- Refining its approach toward optimal play

## Implementation
